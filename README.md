How much do graduate students pay for their degrees? How much do they get paid in stipends--if anything? Which schools and departments provide the best support for students? GradPay is trying to answer these questions and more by asking graduate students about the support they get from their programs.

This repository contains all the code behind the GradPay site, which is currently available <a href="http://www.gradpay.org/">here</a>. Enjoy!
