            All responses submitted to GradPay are stored securely and privately. Summary statistics (for example, median stipend at each institution) will be made available through the GradPay site, but individual responses will not be displayed. Identifying information, such as email addresses, will not be released; email addresses are only collected to verify institutional affiliations. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="gradpay.survey@gmail.com">gradpay.survey@gmail.com</a>.
